# Hi, I'm Samhita Kolluri! ✨

As a graduate student at Northeastern University, I bring a strong foundation in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, with expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced AI techniques. With over 2 years of professional experience as a Data Engineer at Cognizant, I worked with a leading insurance client, optimizing property and casualty insurance data pipelines and delivering actionable insights. 

Passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, I aim to create innovative solutions that drive meaningful impact. I’m on the hunt for job opportunities where I can contribute to and grow with a team dedicated to innovation and excellence in the tech space.
